[1mBASH BUILTIN COMMANDS[0m
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by  [1m-  [22maccepts
       [1m--  [22mto  signify  the  end  of the options.  The [1m:[22m, [1mtrue[22m, [1mfalse[22m, and [1mtest[22m/[1m[ [22mbuiltins do not accept options and do not
       treat [1m-- [22mspecially.  The [1mexit[22m, [1mlogout[22m, [1mreturn[22m, [1mbreak[22m, [1mcontinue[22m, [1mlet[22m, and [1mshift [22mbuiltins accept and process arguments
       beginning  with [1m- [22mwithout requiring [1m--[22m.  Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting op‐
       tions interpret arguments beginning with [1m- [22mas invalid options and require [1m-- [22mto prevent this interpretation.
       [1m: [22m[[4marguments[24m]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding [4marguments[24m and  performing  any  specified  redirections.
              The return status is zero.

        [1m.  [4m[22mfilename[24m [[4marguments[24m]
       [1msource [4m[22mfilename[24m [[4marguments[24m]
              Read  and  execute  commands from [4mfilename[24m in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the
              last command executed from [4mfilename[24m.  If [4mfilename[24m does not contain a slash, filenames in  [1mPATH  [22mare  used  to
              find  the directory containing [4mfilename[24m.  The file searched for in [1mPATH [22mneed not be executable.  When [1mbash [22mis
              not in [4mposix[24m [4mmode[24m, the current directory is searched if no file is found in [1mPATH[22m.  If the  [1msourcepath  [22moption
              to  the  [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin command is turned off, the [1mPATH [22mis not searched.  If any [4marguments[24m are supplied, they
              become the positional parameters when [4mfilename[24m is executed.  Otherwise  the  positional  parameters  are  un‐
              changed.  If the [1m-T [22moption is enabled, [1msource [22minherits any trap on [1mDEBUG[22m; if it is not, any [1mDEBUG [22mtrap string
              is saved and restored around the call to [1msource[22m, and [1msource [22munsets the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap while it executes.   If  [1m-T[0m
              is  not  set,  and  the sourced file changes the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap, the new value is retained when [1msource [22mcompletes.
              The return status is the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed),
              and false if [4mfilename[24m is not found or cannot be read.

       [1malias [22m[[1m-p[22m] [[4mname[24m[=[4mvalue[24m] ...]
              [1mAlias  [22mwith  no  arguments  or  with the [1m-p [22moption prints the list of aliases in the form [1malias [4m[22mname[24m=[4mvalue[24m on
              standard output.  When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each [4mname[24m whose  [4mvalue[24m  is  given.   A
              trailing space in [4mvalue[24m causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.
              For each [4mname[24m in the argument list for which no [4mvalue[24m is supplied,  the  name  and  value  of  the  alias  is
              printed.  [1mAlias [22mreturns true unless a [4mname[24m is given for which no alias has been defined.

       [1mbg [22m[[4mjobspec[24m ...]
              Resume  each  suspended  job  [4mjobspec[24m in the background, as if it had been started with [1m&[22m.  If [4mjobspec[24m is not
              present, the shell's notion of the [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m is used.  [1mbg [4m[22mjobspec[24m returns 0 unless run when job control  is
              disabled  or,  when  run with job control enabled, any specified [4mjobspec[24m was not found or was started without
              job control.

       [1mbuiltin [4m[22mshell-builtin[24m [[4marguments[24m]
              Execute  the  specified shell builtin, passing it [4marguments[24m, and return its exit status.  This is useful when
              defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the  functionality  of  the  builtin
              within  the  function.   The  [1mcd  [22mbuiltin  is  commonly  redefined  this  way.  The return status is false if
              [4mshell-builtin[24m is not a shell builtin command.

       [1mcaller [22m[[4mexpr[24m]

              builtins).  Without [4mexpr[24m, [1mcaller [22mdisplays the line number and source filename of the current subroutine call.
              If a non-negative integer is supplied as [4mexpr[24m, [1mcaller [22mdisplays the line number, subroutine name,  and  source
              file corresponding to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used,
              for example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.  The return value is 0 unless  the  shell
              is not executing a subroutine call or [4mexpr[24m does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.

              Change the current directory to [4mdir[24m.  if [4mdir[24m is not supplied, the value of the [1mHOME [22mshell variable is the de‐
              fault.  Any additional arguments following [4mdir[24m are ignored.  The variable [1mCDPATH [22mdefines the search path  for
              the directory containing [4mdir[24m: each directory name in [1mCDPATH [22mis searched for [4mdir[24m.  Alternative directory names
              in [1mCDPATH [22mare separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in [1mCDPATH [22mis the same as  the  current  direc‐
              tory,  i.e., ``[1m.[22m''.  If [4mdir[24m begins with a slash (/), then [1mCDPATH [22mis not used.  The [1m-P [22moption causes [1mcd [22mto use
              the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing [4mdir[24m and before  processing  in‐
              stances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m (see also the [1m-P [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin command); the [1m-L [22moption forces symbolic links
              to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m.  If [4m..[24m appears in  [4mdir[24m,  it  is
              processed  by removing the immediately previous pathname component from [4mdir[24m, back to a slash or the beginning
              of [4mdir[24m.  If the [1m-e [22moption is supplied with [1m-P[22m, and the current working directory cannot be  successfully  de‐
              termined after a successful directory change, [1mcd [22mwill return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that support
              it, the [1m-@ [22moption presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.  An argument  of  [1m-[0m
              is  converted to [1m$OLDPWD [22mbefore the directory change is attempted.  If a non-empty directory name from [1mCDPATH[0m
              is used, or if [1m- [22mis the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of  the
              new  working directory is written to the standard output.  The return value is true if the directory was suc‐
              cessfully changed; false otherwise.

              filename used to invoke [4mcommand[24m to be displayed; the [1m-V [22moption produces a more verbose description.   If  the
              [1m-V  [22mor  [1m-v [22moption is supplied, the exit status is 0 if [4mcommand[24m was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is
              supplied and an error occurred or [4mcommand[24m cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit  sta‐
              tus of the [1mcommand [22mbuiltin is the exit status of [4mcommand[24m.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated  them  di‐
              rectly  from  a  completion  specification with the same flags.  If [4mword[24m is specified, only those completions
              matching [4mword[24m will be displayed.

              mand completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The [1m-I [22moption indicates that other  supplied
              options  and  actions  should  apply to completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a
              command delimiter such as [1m; [22mor [1m|[22m, which is usually command name completion.  If  multiple  options  are  sup‐
              plied, the [1m-D [22moption takes precedence over [1m-E[22m, and both take precedence over [1m-I[22m.  If any of [1m-D[22m, [1m-E[22m, or [1m-I [22mare
              supplied, any other [4mname[24m arguments are ignored; these completions only apply to the case specified by the op‐
              tion.

              The  process of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is described above
              under [1mProgrammable Completion[22m.

              Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The arguments to the [1m-G[22m, [1m-W[22m, and [1m-X [22moptions  (and,
              if  necessary,  the  [1m-P  [22mand  [1m-S [22moptions) should be quoted to protect them from expansion before the [1mcomplete[0m
              builtin is invoked.
              [1m-o [4m[22mcomp-option[0m
                      The [4mcomp-option[24m controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior beyond the simple  generation  of
                      completions.  [4mcomp-option[24m may be one of:
                      [1mbashdefault[0m
                              Perform the rest of the default [1mbash [22mcompletions if the compspec generates no matches.

                      [1mfilenames[0m
                              Tell  readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any filename-specific
                              processing (like adding a slash to directory names, quoting special characters, or  suppress‐
                              ing trailing spaces).  Intended to be used with shell functions.
                      [1mnoquote [22mTell  readline  not  to quote the completed words if they are filenames (quoting filenames is
                              the default).
                      [1mnosort  [22mTell readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically.
                      [1mnospace [22mTell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of the line.
                      [1mplusdirs[0m
                              After any matches defined by the compspec are generated, directory  name  completion  is  at‐
                              tempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.

                      [4mcommand[24m is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions.
              [1m-F [4m[22mfunction[0m
                      The  shell function [4mfunction[24m is executed in the current shell environment.  When the function is exe‐
                      cuted, the first argument ([1m$1[22m) is the name of the command whose arguments are  being  completed,  the
                      second  argument  ([1m$2[22m) is the word being completed, and the third argument ([1m$3[22m) is the word preceding
                      the word being completed on the current command line.  When it finishes, the possible completions are
                      retrieved from the value of the [1mCOMPREPLY [22marray variable.
              [1m-G [4m[22mglobpat[0m
                      The pathname expansion pattern [4mglobpat[24m is expanded to generate the possible completions.
              [1m-P [4m[22mprefix[0m
                      [4mprefix[24m  is  added  at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options have been ap‐
                      plied.
              [1m-S [4m[22msuffix[0m
                      [4msuffix[24m is appended to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              [1m-W [4m[22mwordlist[0m
                      The [4mwordlist[24m is split using the characters in the [1mIFS [22mspecial variable as delimiters, and each resul‐
                      tant word is expanded.  Shell quoting is honored within [4mwordlist[24m, in order to provide a mechanism for
                      the words to contain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of [1mIFS[22m.   The  possible  comple‐
                      tions are the members of the resultant list which match the word being completed.
              [1m-X [4m[22mfilterpat[0m
                      [4mfilterpat[24m is a pattern as used for pathname expansion.  It is applied to the list of possible comple‐
                      tions generated by the preceding options and arguments, and each completion matching [4mfilterpat[24m is re‐
                      moved  from the list.  A leading [1m! [22min [4mfilterpat[24m negates the pattern; in this case, any completion not
                      matching [4mfilterpat[24m is removed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than  [1m-p  [22mor  [1m-r  [22mis  supplied
              without  a  [4mname[24m  argument,  an  attempt is made to remove a completion specification for a [4mname[24m for which no
              specification exists, or an error occurs adding a completion specification.

              Modify completion options for each [4mname[24m according to the [4moption[24ms, or for the  currently-executing  completion
              if  no [4mname[24ms are supplied.  If no [4moption[24ms are given, display the completion options for each [4mname[24m or the cur‐
              rent completion.  The possible values of [4moption[24m are those valid for the  [1mcomplete  [22mbuiltin  described  above.
              The  [1m-D [22moption indicates that other supplied options should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that
              is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been defined.  The [1m-E [22moption in‐
              dicates  that  other  supplied  options should apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion at‐
              tempted on a blank line.  The [1m-I [22moption indicates that other supplied options should apply to  completion  on
              the  initial  non-assignment  word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as [1m; [22mor [1m|[22m, which is usually
              command name completion.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the options for a
              [4mname[24m for which no completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

              the [4mn[24mth enclosing loop.  [4mn[24m must be ≥ 1.  If [4mn[24m is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclos‐
              ing loop (the ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0 unless [4mn[24m is not greater than or equal to
              1.

              Declare variables and/or give them attributes.  If no [4mname[24ms are given then display the values  of  variables.
              The  [1m-p [22moption will display the attributes and values of each [4mname[24m.  When [1m-p [22mis used with [4mname[24m arguments, ad‐
              ditional options, other than [1m-f [22mand [1m-F[22m, are ignored.  When [1m-p [22mis supplied without  [4mname[24m  arguments,  it  will
              display the attributes and values of all variables having the attributes specified by the additional options.
              If no other options are supplied with [1m-p[22m, [1mdeclare [22mwill display the attributes and values of all  shell  vari‐
              ables.   The  [1m-f  [22moption will restrict the display to shell functions.  The [1m-F [22moption inhibits the display of
              function definitions; only the function name and attributes are printed.  If the [1mextdebug [22mshell option is en‐
              abled  using  [1mshopt[22m,  the  source file name and line number where each [4mname[24m is defined are displayed as well.
              The [1m-F [22moption implies [1m-f[22m.  The [1m-g [22moption forces variables to be created or modified at the global scope, even
              when  [1mdeclare [22mis executed in a shell function.  It is ignored in all other cases.  The [1m-I [22moption causes local
              variables to inherit the attributes (except the [4mnameref[24m attribute) and value of any  existing  variable  with
              the  same [4mname[24m at a surrounding scope.  If there is no existing variable, the local variable is initially un‐
              set.  The following options can be used to restrict output to variables with the specified  attribute  or  to
              give variables attributes:
              [1m-a     [22mEach [4mname[24m is an indexed array variable (see [1mArrays [22mabove).

              [1m-i     [22mThe variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see [1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION [22mabove) is per‐

              [1m-l     [22mWhen the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.  The up‐
                     per-case attribute is disabled.
              [1m-n     [22mGive  each  [4mname[24m  the  [4mnameref[24m  attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.  That other
                     variable is defined by the value of [4mname[24m.  All references, assignments, and attribute modifications to
                     [4mname[24m, except those using or changing the [1m-n [22mattribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced
                     by [4mname[24m's value.  The nameref attribute cannot be applied to array variables.
              [1m-r     [22mMake [4mname[24ms readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent  assignment  statements
                     or unset.
              [1m-t     [22mGive  each  [4mname[24m  the  [4mtrace[24m  attribute.  Traced functions inherit the [1mDEBUG [22mand [1mRETURN [22mtraps from the
                     calling shell.  The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              [1m-u     [22mWhen the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are  converted  to  upper-case.   The
                     lower-case attribute is disabled.
              [1m-x     [22mMark [4mname[24ms for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

              Using  `+' instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with the exceptions that [1m+a [22mand [1m+A [22mmay not be used
              to destroy array variables and [1m+r [22mwill not remove the readonly attribute.  When used in a  function,  [1mdeclare[0m
              and [1mtypeset [22mmake each [4mname[24m local, as with the [1mlocal [22mcommand, unless the [1m-g [22moption is supplied.  If a variable
              name is followed by =[4mvalue[24m, the value of the variable is set to [4mvalue[24m.  When using [1m-a [22mor [1m-A [22mand the  compound
              assignment  syntax  to  create array variables, additional attributes do not take effect until subsequent as‐
              signments.  The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is  made  to  define  a

              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name
              as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally searches
              for builtins before disk commands.  If [1m-n [22mis used, each [4mname[24m is disabled; otherwise, [4mnames[24m are enabled.   For
              example,  to  use  the  [1mtest  [22mbinary found via the [1mPATH [22minstead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n
              test''.  The [1m-f [22moption means to load the new builtin command [4mname[24m from shared  object  [4mfilename[24m,  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading.  The [1m-d [22moption will delete a builtin previously loaded with [1m-f[22m.  If no [4mname[24m ar‐
              guments are given, or if the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed.  With no  other  op‐
              tion  arguments,  the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If [1m-n [22mis supplied, only disabled builtins
              are printed.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not
              each  is  enabled.   If  [1m-s  [22mis supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX [4mspecial[24m builtins.  The return
              value is 0 unless a [4mname[24m is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared  ob‐
              ject.

       [1meval [22m[[4marg[24m ...]
              The [4marg[24ms are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read and executed by
              the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of [1meval[22m.  If there are no [4margs[24m, or  only  null  argu‐
              ments, [1meval [22mreturns 0.

       [1mexec [22m[[1m-cl[22m] [[1m-a [4m[22mname[24m] [[4mcommand[24m [[4marguments[24m]]
              If  [4mcommand[24m  is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The [4marguments[24m become the argu‐
              ments to [4mcommand[24m.  If the [1m-l [22moption is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argu‐
              ment  passed  to  [4mcommand[24m.   This is what [4mlogin[24m(1) does.  The [1m-c [22moption causes [4mcommand[24m to be executed with an
              empty environment.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied, the shell passes [4mname[24m as the zeroth argument to the executed  command.
              If  [4mcommand[24m  cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the [1mexecfail [22mshell op‐
              tion is enabled.  In that case, it returns failure.  An interactive shell returns failure if the file  cannot
              be  executed.  A subshell exits unconditionally if [1mexec [22mfails.  If [4mcommand[24m is not specified, any redirections
              take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection  error,  the  return
              status is 1.

       [1mexit [22m[[4mn[24m]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of [4mn[24m.  If [4mn[24m is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command ex‐
              ecuted.  A trap on [1mEXIT [22mis executed before the shell terminates.

       [1mexport -p[0m
              The supplied [4mnames[24m are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.   If
              the  [1m-f  [22moption  is  given, the [4mnames[24m refer to functions.  If no [4mnames[24m are given, or if the [1m-p [22moption is sup‐
              plied, a list of names of all exported variables is printed.  The [1m-n [22moption causes the export property to  be
              removed  from  each [4mname[24m.  If a variable name is followed by =[4mword[24m, the value of the variable is set to [4mword[24m.
              [1mexport [22mreturns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the [4mnames[24m is not  a  valid
              shell variable name, or [1m-f [22mis supplied with a [4mname[24m that is not a function.

       [1mfc -s [22m[[4mpat[24m=[4mrep[24m] [[4mcmd[24m]
              The first form selects a range of commands from [4mfirst[24m to [4mlast[24m from the history list and displays or edits and
              re-executes them.  [4mFirst[24m and [4mlast[24m may be specified as a string (to locate the  last  command  beginning  with
              that  string)  or  as  a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset
              from the current command number).  When listing, a [4mfirst[24m or [4mlast[24m of 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0  is  equiva‐
              lent  to the current command (usually the [1mfc [22mcommand); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If
              [4mlast[24m is not specified, it is set to the current command for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10
              commands)  and  to [4mfirst[24m otherwise.  If [4mfirst[24m is not specified, it is set to the previous command for editing
              and -16 for listing.

              The [1m-n [22moption suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The [1m-r [22moption reverses the order of the commands.
              If  the [1m-l [22moption is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by [4mename[0m
              is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If [4mename[24m is not given, the value of the [1mFCEDIT  [22mvariable  is
              used, and the value of [1mEDITOR [22mif [1mFCEDIT [22mis not set.  If neither variable is set, [4mvi[24m is used.  When editing is
              complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, [4mcommand[24m is re-executed after each instance of [4mpat[24m is replaced by [4mrep[24m.  [4mCommand[24m is  inter‐
              preted  the  same  as [4mfirst[24m above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that typing ``r cc''
              runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.

              If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered  or  [4mfirst[24m  or  [4mlast[0m
              specify  history lines out of range.  If the [1m-e [22moption is supplied, the return value is the value of the last
              command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the  second  form  is
              used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless [4mcmd[24m does not specify a valid history line,
              in which case [1mfc [22mreturns failure.

       [1mfg [22m[[4mjobspec[24m]
              Resume [4mjobspec[24m in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If [4mjobspec[24m is not present, the shell's notion
              of  the  [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m is used.  The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground, or failure
              if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if  [4mjobspec[24m  does  not  specify  a
              valid job or [4mjobspec[24m specifies a job that was started without job control.

       [1mgetopts [4m[22moptstring[24m [4mname[24m [[4marg[24m [4m...[24m]
              [1mgetopts [22mis used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  [4moptstring[24m contains the option characters
              to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have  an  argument,  which
              should be separated from it by white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not be used as option
              characters.  Each time it is invoked, [1mgetopts [22mplaces the next option in the shell variable [4mname[24m, initializing
              [4mname[24m  if  it  does  not  exist,  and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable [1mOPTIND[22m.
              [1mOPTIND [22mis initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an  ar‐
              gument,  [1mgetopts  [22mplaces  that  argument into the variable [1mOPTARG[22m.  The shell does not reset [1mOPTIND [22mautomati‐
              cally; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to [1mgetopts [22mwithin the same shell invocation if a  new
              set of parameters is to be used.

              When  the  end of options is encountered, [1mgetopts [22mexits with a return value greater than zero.  [1mOPTIND [22mis set
              to the index of the first non-option argument, and [4mname[24m is set to ?.

              [1mgetopts [22mnormally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are supplied as [4marg[24m values,  [1mgetopts[0m
              parses those instead.

              [1mgetopts  [22mcan report errors in two ways.  If the first character of [4moptstring[24m is a colon, [4msilent[24m error report‐
              ing is used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing option ar‐
              guments  are  encountered.   If the variable [1mOPTERR [22mis set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if
              the first character of [4moptstring[24m is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, [1mgetopts [22mplaces ? into [4mname[24m and, if not silent, prints an error message and  un‐
              sets  [1mOPTARG[22m.  If [1mgetopts [22mis silent, the option character found is placed in [1mOPTARG [22mand no diagnostic message
              is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and [1mgetopts [22mis not silent, a question mark ([1m?[22m) is placed in [4mname[24m, [1mOPTARG[0m
              is  unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If [1mgetopts [22mis silent, then a colon ([1m:[22m) is placed in [4mname[24m and
              [1mOPTARG [22mis set to the option character found.

              [1mgetopts [22mreturns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the  end  of  op‐
              tions is encountered or an error occurs.

              Each  time  [1mhash [22mis invoked, the full pathname of the command [4mname[24m is determined by searching the directories
              in [1m$PATH [22mand remembered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied,  no
              path search is performed, and [4mfilename[24m is used as the full filename of the command.  The [1m-r [22moption causes the
              shell to forget all remembered locations.  The [1m-d [22moption causes the shell to forget the  remembered  location
              of each [4mname[24m.  If the [1m-t [22moption is supplied, the full pathname to which each [4mname[24m corresponds is printed.  If
              multiple [4mname[24m arguments are supplied with [1m-t[22m, the [4mname[24m is printed before the hashed full  pathname.   The  [1m-l[0m
              option  causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.  If no arguments are given, or
              if only [1m-l [22mis supplied, information about remembered commands is printed.  The return status is true unless a

              [4mfilename[24m is supplied, it is used as the name of the history file; if not, the value of [1mHISTFILE [22mis used.  Op‐
              tions, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              [1m-c     [22mClear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              [1m-d [4m[22moffset[0m
                     Delete  the history entry at position [4moffset[24m.  If [4moffset[24m is negative, it is interpreted as relative to
                     one greater than the last history position, so negative indices count back from the end  of  the  his‐
                     tory, and an index of -1 refers to the current [1mhistory -d [22mcommand.
              [1m-d [4m[22mstart[24m-[4mend[0m

                     for [4mstart[24m and [4mend[24m are interpreted as described above.

                     before the [4margs[24m are added.

              If the [1mHISTTIMEFORMAT [22mvariable is set, the time stamp information associated with each history entry is writ‐
              ten to the history file, marked with the history comment character.  When the history file is read, lines be‐
              ginning  with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for
              the following history entry.  The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error  occurs
              while reading or writing the history file, an invalid [4moffset[24m is supplied as an argument to [1m-d[22m, or the history

              case-insensitive signal name such as [1mSIGKILL [22m(with or without the [1mSIG [22mprefix) or a signal number; [4msignum[24m is a
              signal  number.   If  [4msigspec[24m  is  not  present, then [1mSIGTERM [22mis assumed.  An argument of [1m-l [22mlists the signal
              names.  If any arguments are supplied when [1m-l [22mis given, the names of the signals corresponding to  the  argu‐
              ments are listed, and the return status is 0.  The [4mexit_status[24m argument to [1m-l [22mis a number specifying either a
              signal number or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.  The [1m-L [22moption  is  equivalent  to  [1m-l[22m.
              [1mkill [22mreturns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid op‐
              tion is encountered.

              Each [4marg[24m is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see [1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION  [22mabove).   If  the  last  [4marg[0m

       [1mlocal [22m[[4moption[24m] [[4mname[24m[=[4mvalue[24m] ... | - ]
              For  each argument, a local variable named [4mname[24m is created, and assigned [4mvalue[24m.  The [4moption[24m can be any of the
              options accepted by [1mdeclare[22m.  When [1mlocal [22mis used within a function, it causes the variable  [4mname[24m  to  have  a
              visible  scope  restricted to that function and its children.  If [4mname[24m is -, the set of shell options is made
              local to the function in which [1mlocal [22mis invoked: shell options changed using the [1mset [22mbuiltin inside the func‐
              tion are restored to their original values when the function returns.  The restore is effected as if a series
              of [1mset [22mcommands were executed to restore the values that were in place before the function.   With  no  oper‐
              ands,  [1mlocal  [22mwrites  a list of local variables to the standard output.  It is an error to use [1mlocal [22mwhen not
              within a function.  The return status is 0 unless [1mlocal [22mis used outside a function, an invalid [4mname[24m  is  sup‐

              Removes  entries  from the directory stack.  With no arguments, removes the top directory from the stack, and
              performs a [1mcd [22mto the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:

              If  the  [1mpopd  [22mcommand  is successful, a [1mdirs [22mis performed as well, and the return status is 0.  [1mpopd [22mreturns
              false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack entry
              is specified, or the directory change fails.

       [1mprintf [22m[[1m-v [4m[22mvar[24m] [4mformat[24m [[4marguments[24m]
              Write  the  formatted [4marguments[24m to the standard output under the control of the [4mformat[24m.  The [1m-v [22moption causes
              the output to be assigned to the variable [4mvar[24m rather than being printed to the standard output.

              The [4mformat[24m is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters,  which  are  simply
              copied to standard output, character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output,
              and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive [4margument[24m.  In addition to the
              standard [4mprintf[24m(1) format specifications, [1mprintf [22minterprets the following extensions:
              [1m%b     [22mcauses  [1mprintf  [22mto  expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding [4margument[24m in the same way as
                     [1mecho -e[22m.
              [1m%q     [22mcauses [1mprintf [22mto output the corresponding [4margument[24m in a format that can be reused as shell input.
              [1m%([4m[22mdatefmt[24m[1m)T[0m
                     causes [1mprintf [22mto output the date-time string resulting from using [4mdatefmt[24m as a format string for [4mstrf‐[0m
                     [4mtime[24m(3).  The corresponding [4margument[24m is an integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch.
                     Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2  represents  the  time
                     the shell was invoked.  If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given.  This
                     is an exception to the usual [1mprintf [22mbehavior.

              The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and precision arguments from the  format  specification
              and  write  that many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded argument, which usually contains
              more characters than the original.

              Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a  leading  plus  or  minus
              sign  is  allowed,  and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII value of
              the following character.

              The [4mformat[24m is reused as necessary to consume all of the [4marguments[24m.  If the  [4mformat[24m  requires  more  [4marguments[0m
              than  are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as appropriate,
              had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

              the line into words using the same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under [1mWord Splitting[22m).
              The backslash character ([1m\[22m) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next  character  read  and  for
              line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              [1m-a [4m[22maname[0m
                     The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable [4maname[24m, starting at 0.  [4maname[24m is un‐
                     set before any new values are assigned.  Other [4mname[24m arguments are ignored.
              [1m-d [4m[22mdelim[0m
                     The first character of [4mdelim[24m is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.   If  [4mdelim[24m  is
                     the empty string, [1mread [22mwill terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.

                     tings, but uses Readline's default filename completion.

                     unless EOF is encountered or [1mread [22mtimes out.  Delimiter characters encountered in the  input  are  not
                     treated specially and do not cause [1mread [22mto return until [4mnchars[24m characters are read.  The result is not
                     split on the characters in [1mIFS[22m; the intent is that the variable is  assigned  exactly  the  characters
                     read (with the exception of backslash; see the [1m-r [22moption below).

                     acters) is not read within [4mtimeout[24m seconds.  [4mtimeout[24m may be a decimal number with a fractional portion
                     following  the decimal point.  This option is only effective if [1mread [22mis reading input from a terminal,

                     mediately, without trying to read any data.  The exit status is 0 if input is available on the  speci‐
                     fied  file  descriptor, non-zero otherwise.  The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is ex‐

              If no [4mnames[24m are supplied, the line read, without the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified,  is  assigned
              to  the variable [1mREPLY[22m.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, [1mread [22mtimes out (in which
              case the status is greater than 128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a readonly  variable)
              occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to [1m-u[22m.

              The  given  [4mnames[24m are marked readonly; the values of these [4mnames[24m may not be changed by subsequent assignment.
              If the [1m-f [22moption is supplied, the functions corresponding to the [4mnames[24m are so  marked.   The  [1m-a  [22moption  re‐
              stricts  the  variables  to  indexed arrays; the [1m-A [22moption restricts the variables to associative arrays.  If
              both options are supplied, [1m-A [22mtakes precedence.  If no [4mname[24m arguments are given, or if the [1m-p [22moption is  sup‐
              plied,  a  list  of all readonly names is printed.  The other options may be used to restrict the output to a
              subset of the set of readonly names.  The [1m-p [22moption causes output to be displayed in a  format  that  may  be
              reused as input.  If a variable name is followed by =[4mword[24m, the value of the variable is set to [4mword[24m.  The re‐
              turn status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the [4mnames[24m is  not  a  valid  shell  variable
              name, or [1m-f [22mis supplied with a [4mname[24m that is not a function.

       [1mreturn [22m[[4mn[24m]
              Causes  a function to stop executing and return the value specified by [4mn[24m to its caller.  If [4mn[24m is omitted, the
              return status is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If [1mreturn [22mis  executed  by  a  trap
              handler,  the last command used to determine the status is the last command executed before the trap handler.
              If [1mreturn [22mis executed during a [1mDEBUG [22mtrap, the last command used to determine the status is the last  command
              executed by the trap handler before [1mreturn [22mwas invoked.  If [1mreturn [22mis used outside a function, but during ex‐
              ecution of a script by the [1m.  [22m([1msource[22m) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and  return
              either  [4mn[24m or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script.
              If [4mn[24m is supplied, the return value is its least significant 8 bits.  The return status is non-zero if  [1mreturn[0m
              is  supplied  a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function and not during execution of a script by [1m.[0m
              or [1msource[22m.  Any command associated with the [1mRETURN [22mtrap is executed before execution resumes after the  func‐

                      on [1mERR[22m, if set, is executed before the shell exits.  This option applies to the shell environment and
                      each subshell environment separately (see [1mCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT [22mabove), and  may  cause  sub‐

                      If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without
                      an  intervening  command (see [1mJOB CONTROL [22mabove).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are
                      stopped.

                      ences in words to be completed.  This means that dollar signs in variable names that expand to direc‐
                      tories  will  not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, ei‐
                      ther.  This is active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames.   This  vari‐
                      able is set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2.

              Each  operator  and operand must be a separate argument.  Expressions are composed of the primaries described

              Expressions  may  be  combined  using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence.  The

              [1mtest [22mand [1m[ [22mevaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is [1m![22m, the expression is true if and only if the second argument is null.  If the
                     first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed above under  [1mCONDITIONAL  EXPRESSIONS[22m,
                     the  expression  is true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is not a valid unary condi‐
                     tional operator, the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one of the binary
                     conditional  operators listed above under [1mCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS[22m, the result of the expression is the
                     result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands.  The [1m-a  [22mand  [1m-o  [22moperators
                     are considered binary operators when there are three arguments.  If the first argument is [1m![22m, the value
                     is the negation of the two-argument test using the second and third arguments.  If the first  argument
                     is  exactly  [1m(  [22mand the third argument is exactly [1m)[22m, the result is the one-argument test of the second
                     argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     If the first argument is [1m![22m, the result is the negation of the three-argument  expression  composed  of
                     the  remaining  arguments.   Otherwise, the expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence
                     using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.

              When used with [1mtest [22mor [1m[[22m, the [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moperators sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

       [1mtrap [22m[[1m-lp[22m] [[[4marg[24m] [4msigspec[24m ...]
              The  command [4marg[24m is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) [4msigspec[24m.  If [4marg[24m is absent (and
              there is a single [4msigspec[24m) or [1m-[22m, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had
              upon  entrance  to  the shell).  If [4marg[24m is the null string the signal specified by each [4msigspec[24m is ignored by
              the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If [4marg[24m is not present and [1m-p [22mhas been supplied, then the trap com‐
              mands  associated with each [4msigspec[24m are displayed.  If no arguments are supplied or if only [1m-p [22mis given, [1mtrap[0m
              prints the list of commands associated with each signal.  The [1m-l [22moption causes the shell to print a  list  of
              signal names and their corresponding numbers.  Each [4msigspec[24m is either a signal name defined in <[4msignal.h[24m>, or
              a signal number.  Signal names are case insensitive and the [1mSIG [22mprefix is optional.

              If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mEXIT [22m(0) the command [4marg[24m is executed on exit from the shell.  If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mDEBUG[22m, the com‐
              mand [4marg[24m is executed before every [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m, [4mfor[24m command, [4mcase[24m command, [4mselect[24m command, every arithmetic
              [4mfor[24m command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see [1mSHELL GRAMMAR [22mabove).   Refer  to
              the  description of the [1mextdebug [22moption to the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin for details of its effect on the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap.  If
              a [4msigspec[24m is [1mRETURN[22m, the command [4marg[24m is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with  the  [1m.[0m
              or [1msource [22mbuiltins finishes executing.

              If  a  [4msigspec[24m  is [1mERR[22m, the command [4marg[24m is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple
              command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following  conditions.
              The  [1mERR [22mtrap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a [1mwhile[0m
              or [1muntil [22mkeyword, part of the test in an [4mif[24m statement, part of a command executed in a [1m&& [22mor [1m||  [22mlist  except
              the  command following the final [1m&& [22mor [1m||[22m, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return
              value is being inverted using [1m![22m.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the [1merrexit [22m([1m-e[22m) option.

              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped, reset or listed.  Trapped signals that are not be‐
              ing  ignored  are  reset  to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created.
              The return status is false if any [4msigspec[24m is invalid; otherwise [1mtrap [22mreturns true.

       [1mtype [22m[[1m-aftpP[22m] [4mname[24m [[4mname[24m ...]
              With no options, indicate how each [4mname[24m would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the [1m-t [22moption  is
              used,  [1mtype  [22mprints  a string which is one of [4malias[24m, [4mkeyword[24m, [4mfunction[24m, [4mbuiltin[24m, or [4mfile[24m if [4mname[24m is an alias,
              shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the [4mname[24m is not found,  then  nothing
              is  printed, and an exit status of false is returned.  If the [1m-p [22moption is used, [1mtype [22meither returns the name
              of the disk file that would be executed if [4mname[24m were specified as a command name, or  nothing  if  ``type  -t
              name''  would  not  return  [4mfile[24m.  The [1m-P [22moption forces a [1mPATH [22msearch for each [4mname[24m, even if ``type -t name''
              would not return [4mfile[24m.  If a command is hashed, [1m-p [22mand [1m-P [22mprint the hashed value, which  is  not  necessarily
              the file that appears first in [1mPATH[22m.  If the [1m-a [22moption is used, [1mtype [22mprints all of the places that contain an
              executable named [4mname[24m.  This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the [1m-p [22moption is not  also  used.
              The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using [1m-a[22m.  The [1m-f [22moption suppresses shell function lookup,
              as with the [1mcommand [22mbuiltin.  [1mtype [22mreturns true if all of the arguments are  found,  false  if  any  are  not
              found.

              Provides  control  over  the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that
              allow such control.  The [1m-H [22mand [1m-S [22moptions specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource.
              A  hard  limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the
              value of the hard limit.  If neither [1m-H [22mnor [1m-S [22mis specified, both the soft and  hard  limits  are  set.   The
              value  of  [4mlimit[24m  can  be  a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values [1mhard[22m,
              [1msoft[22m, or [1munlimited[22m, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit,  and  no  limit,  respec‐
              tively.   If  [4mlimit[24m is omitted, the current value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the [1m-H[0m
              option is given.  When more than one resource is specified, the limit name  and  unit,  if  appropriate,  are
              printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:

              The user file-creation mask is set to [4mmode[24m.  If [4mmode[24m begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal  num‐

              omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The [1m-S [22moption causes the mask to be printed  in  symbolic
              form;  the  default output is an octal number.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, and [4mmode[24m is omitted, the output
              is in a form that may be reused as input.  The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or  if

              a  shell  variable, and that variable is removed.  Read-only variables may not be unset.  If [1m-f [22mis specified,
              each [4mname[24m refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.  If the [1m-n [22moption is  supplied,
              and [4mname[24m is a variable with the [4mnameref[24m attribute, [4mname[24m will be unset rather than the variable it references.
              [1m-n [22mhas no effect if the [1m-f [22moption is supplied.  If no options are supplied, each [4mname[24m refers to  a  variable;
              if  there  is  no variable by that name, a function with that name, if any, is unset.  Each unset variable or

              Wait  for  each  specified child process and return its termination status.  Each [4mid[24m may be a process ID or a
              job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If [4mid[24m is not
              given,  [1mwait [22mwaits for all running background jobs and the last-executed process substitution, if its process
              id is the same as [1m$![22m, and the return status is zero.  If the [1m-n [22moption is supplied, [1mwait [22mwaits for  a  single
              job  from  the  list of [4mid[24ms or, if no [4mid[24ms are supplied, any job, to complete and returns its exit status.  If
              none of the supplied arguments is a child of the shell, or if no arguments are supplied and the shell has  no
              unwaited-for  children,  the exit status is 127.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, the process or job identifier
              of the job for which the exit status is returned is assigned to the variable [4mvarname[24m named by the option  ar‐
              gument.  The variable will be unset initially, before any assignment.  This is useful only when the [1m-n [22moption
              is supplied.  Supplying the [1m-f [22moption, when job control is enabled, forces [1mwait [22mto wait for [4mid[24m  to  terminate
              before  returning  its  status,  instead of returning when it changes status.  If [4mid[24m specifies a non-existent
              process or job, the return status is 127.  Otherwise, the return status  is  the  exit  status  of  the  last
              process or job waited for.

[1mSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE[0m
       Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a `shell compatibility level', specified as a set of options to the shopt builtin
       [1mcompat31[22m, [1mcompat32[22m, [1mcompat40[22m, [1mcompat41[22m, and so on).  There is only one current compatibility level -- each option is
       mutually  exclusive.   The  compatibility level is intended to allow users to select behavior from previous versions
       that is incompatible with newer versions while they migrate scripts to use current features and behavior.  It's  in‐
       tended to be a temporary solution.

       This  section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular version (e.g., setting [1mcompat32 [22mmeans that
       quoting the rhs of the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the word, which is  default  be‐
       havior in bash-3.2 and above).

       If  a  user enables, say, [1mcompat32[22m, it may affect the behavior of other compatibility levels up to and including the
       current compatibility level.  The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior that changed in that  ver‐
       sion  of [1mbash[22m, but that behavior may have been present in earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-
       based comparisons with the [1m[[ [22mcommand came in bash-4.1, and earlier versions used ASCII-based  comparisons,  so  en‐
       abling  [1mcompat32  [22mwill enable ASCII-based comparisons as well.  That granularity may not be sufficient for all uses,
       and as a result users should employ compatibility levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular feature
       to find out the current behavior.

       Bash-4.3  introduced a new shell variable: [1mBASH_COMPAT[22m.  The value assigned to this variable (a decimal version num‐
       ber like 4.2, or an integer corresponding to the [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m option, like 42) determines the compatibility level.

       Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older compatibility levels.  Eventually, the options will be  re‐
       moved in favor of [1mBASH_COMPAT[22m.

       Bash-5.0  is  the  final  version for which there will be an individual shopt option for the previous version. Users
       should use [1mBASH_COMPAT [22mon bash-5.0 and later versions.

       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each compatibility level setting.  The [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m tag
       is  used as shorthand for setting the compatibility level to [4mNN[24m using one of the following mechanisms.  For versions
       prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be set using the corresponding [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m shopt option.   For  bash-4.3
       and later versions, the [1mBASH_COMPAT [22mvariable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       [1mcompat31[0m
              •      quoting the rhs of the [1m[[ [22mcommand's regexp matching operator (=~) has no special effect

       [1mcompat32[0m
              •      interrupting  a  command list such as "a ; b ; c" causes the execution of the next command in the list
                     (in bash-4.0 and later versions, the shell acts as if it received the interrupt, so  interrupting  one
                     command in a list aborts the execution of the entire list)

       [1mcompat40[0m
              •      the  [1m<  [22mand  [1m>  [22moperators to the [1m[[ [22mcommand do not consider the current locale when comparing strings;
                     they use ASCII ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and [4mstrcmp[24m(3);  bash-4.1
                     and later use the current locale's collation sequence and [4mstrcoll[24m(3).

       [1mcompat41[0m
              •      in  [4mposix[24m  mode,  [1mtime  [22mmay be followed by options and still be recognized as a reserved word (this is
                     POSIX interpretation 267)
              •      in [4mposix[24m mode, the parser requires that an even number of single quotes occur in the [4mword[24m portion of a
                     double-quoted  parameter  expansion  and  treats  them specially, so that characters within the single
                     quotes are considered quoted (this is POSIX interpretation 221)

       [1mcompat42[0m
              •      the replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitution does not undergo  quote  removal,  as  it
                     does in versions after bash-4.2
              •      in posix mode, single quotes are considered special when expanding the [4mword[24m portion of a double-quoted
                     parameter expansion and can be used to quote a closing brace or other special character (this is  part
                     of  POSIX  interpretation  221); in later versions, single quotes are not special within double-quoted
                     word expansions

       [1mcompat43[0m
              •      the shell does not print a warning message if an attempt is made to use a quoted  compound  assignment
                     as an argument to declare (declare -a foo='(1 2)'). Later versions warn that this usage is deprecated
              •      word  expansion errors are considered non-fatal errors that cause the current command to fail, even in
                     posix mode (the default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause the shell to exit)
              •      when executing a shell function, the loop state (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so [1mbreak [22mor [1mcontinue[0m
                     in  that  function  will  break or continue loops in the calling context. Bash-4.4 and later reset the
                     loop state to prevent this

       [1mcompat44[0m
              •      the shell sets up the values used by [1mBASH_ARGV [22mand [1mBASH_ARGC [22mso they can expand to the  shell's  posi‐
                     tional parameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled
              •      a  subshell  inherits  loops  from its parent context, so [1mbreak [22mor [1mcontinue [22mwill cause the subshell to
                     exit.  Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
              •      variable assignments preceding builtins like [1mexport [22mand [1mreadonly [22mthat set attributes continue  to  af‐
                     fect variables with the same name in the calling environment even if the shell is not in posix mode

       [1mcompat50[0m
              •      Bash-5.1 changed the way [1m$RANDOM [22mis generated to introduce slightly more randomness. If the shell com‐
                     patibility level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from bash-5.0 and previous  versions,
                     so  seeding  the random number generator by assigning a value to [1mRANDOM [22mwill produce the same sequence
                     as in bash-5.0
              •      If the command hash table is empty, bash versions prior to bash-5.1 printed an  informational  message
                     to  that effect, even when producing output that can be reused as input. Bash-5.1 suppresses that mes‐
                     sage when the [1m-l [22moption is supplied.
